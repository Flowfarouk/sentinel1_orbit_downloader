# Sentinel-1 Precise Orbit Downloader
Joaquin Escayo Menendez j.escayo@csic.es

This is a very simple script to download all orbit files for Sentinel-1.
It runs in any modern Linux distribution and uses bash and other command line tools.
Download folder must be configured before executing it, edit sentinel1_orbit_downloader.sh and modify DOWN_DIR variable.
